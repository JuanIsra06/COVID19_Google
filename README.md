# COVID-19 Open Data â€“ Snowflake + dbt Project

This repository contains a **dbt project** for modeling the [Google COVID-19 Open Data](https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/) in **Snowflake**.  
It transforms raw JSON/CSV files staged in Snowflake into a clean, documented data warehouse optimized for analytics.
